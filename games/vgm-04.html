        Your favorite board game and reality TV show, combined into one! 
        The goal of Survivor Monopoly is the same as regular Monopoly - bankrupt your opponents to win. 
        In this version, however, properties are replaced with castaways, the contestants on Survivor, so you're basically building a fantasy team.
        Even more Survivor-esque changes have been made to the game as well, including a few more spaces to shake up the game even more.
